# Running the code
> Note: [Pdf](Assignment1.pdf) file is well formatted and easy to read. Section `1.9` contains all the inferences and comparisons of the models. It is recommended to read this section first.

## Requirements
- **Jupyter Notebook Support**
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies in your environment.

## Running the code
- Run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal to open the notebook in your browser.
- Open the `Assignment1.ipynb` file and run the cells in the notebook.

## Simply want to see the results?
- Open the `Assignment1.pdf` file to see the results of the notebook.

# Assignment #1 - Predicting Heart Disease
Heart Disease prediction using Machine Learning

> This assignment focuses on understanding and comparing the performance of different machine learning models for predicting whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) based on a given dataset. You will analyse Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree,  KNN and other relevant techniques.


## Instructions:

### Code Overview:
- [x] Exploratory Data Analysis
- [x] Feature Selection: for this use PCA 
- [x] Feature Scaling: for this use PCA
- [x] Test - Train Split
- [x] Resampling
- [x] Model Pipeline
- [x] Modelling & Evaluation
- [x] Apply model

### Contrast the performance of the three models:
Discuss strengths and weaknesses of  Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree,  KNN  for predicting Heart Disease.

Identify the most suitable model for the task based on accuracy and efficiency.

The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Variables Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors.

Link of the dataset: [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cUcAkM2EawL1JW4ZW4q6ieKiQDDvhHLn?usp=sharing)

Create a folder with the name Asgn1_\<YourRoll>. Copy your code and all your supporting files including one README file on how to execute the code. ZIP the folder and upload in the Moodle server within the deadline.
